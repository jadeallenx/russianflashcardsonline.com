# Здравствуйте
My name is Mark Allen and I started learning Russian in February 2018. I began at first by
using Duolingo, but I realized pretty quickly that if I was really serious about learning
to speak Russian then I needed to put in some serious time with some flash cards to help
pick up the grammar.

I watched [a video][1] which was very influential in my approach to developing my
flash cards.  In the video, the speaker talks about remembering case endings by having
memorized example sentences to cover the most common endings. I thought this was an
excellent approach to remembering how to use case endings as correctly as possible,
hoping that in time and with a lot of practice, recall of the endings would be 
reasonably quick.

I am also a professional software developer, so I quickly wrote a prototype which
could emit some of these "example sentences" but I decided that I wanted to 
[create a library][2] which I could embed in several different tools. One of the
tools I wanted to make was something that could build flash card decks easily
and quickly.

Over time using this tool, I created a collection of flash card decks which
can really help you systematically memorize the case endings for Russian.

I have now created this website to help distribute the flash card decks to
a broader audience. I hope you find them helpful!
