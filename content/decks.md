# Cases #
These flashcards drill endings for cases. 

**Note**: These phrases in the flash cards were *randomly generated* - that
means often they do not make sense (example: моя синяя ошибка - my blue
mistake) but the point of these decks is not to memorize the phrases
directly, but to practice the endings.

## Singular nouns ##
I recommend you begin with genitive case first. **Why?** This is because
animate male and neuter nouns "borrow" the endings for genitive case
when they are used in accusitive case. So starting with genitive
case first allows you to get a good running jump into accusitive
case which ought to be the second case you practice.

# Prepositions
This deck will help you practice and remember cases associated 
with specific prepositions. It can also help you remember how
prepositions are used to have different meanings in the context 
of our example sentences.
