# Cases #
These flashcards drill endings for cases.

**Note**: These phrases in the flash cards were *randomly generated* - that
means often they do not make sense (example: моя синяя ошибка - my blue
mistake) but the point of these decks is not to memorize the phrases
directly, but to practice the endings.

## Singular nouns ##
I recommend you begin with genitive case first. **Why?** This is because
animate male and neuter nouns "borrow" the endings for genitive case
when they are used in accusitive case. So starting with genitive
case first allows you to get a good running jump into accusitive
case which ought to be the second case you practice.

- [Genitive-Accusitive-Prepositional-Dative-Instrumental](/decks/Russian%20Gen-Acc-Prep-Dat-Inst%20Cases.apkg)

## Plural nouns ##
You'll notice there's no coverage of "accusitive" case plurals but that's
because the accusitive case with plural nouns borrows either nominative or
genitive plural forms depending on if the noun is animate.

Except for genitive, plural endings are quite regular across all nouns and
adjectives regardless of the noun's gender.

# Prepositions
This deck will help you practice and remember cases associated
with specific prepositions. The examples demonstrate the
way in which prepositions are used to express different concepts.
In some cases, the case used by a preposition changes with its
meaning.

These decks were generated using [this software][3].

This is the main preposition deck. It contains 98 cards covering
around 60 prepositions. On the front of the card is an example
sentence using the preposition.  The preposition is highlighted.

The back of the card contains the preposition, the meaning
of the preposition, the case it uses and a translation of
the example sentence.

There is also an "advanced" deck which contains 23 less frequent
prepositions.

These two decks would not be possible to build without help from
[Max][max], Anna [@russian\_for\_americans][anna],
Katya [@russian\_foryou][katya], [Ilona][ilona],
and Marina.  Thank you so much!

# Personal pronouns
I recently discovered that I was pretty shaky on personal pronouns in
dative, instrumental and prepositional cases, so I made a deck to practice
them all.  [The source code to generate the import file is here.](https://gist.github.com/mrallen1/eea475f2e1c6d67f82c667d17c8ccdd0)
